# Basics

Words or literals
Words - can do things. Eg,

```
\ commonly used words

+
.
cr \ carriage return (new line)
```
Literals - push themselves onto the stack. Eg,

## Making new words

New line = action

### The way of the Smojo
*Beginners create Messy words -*  
*words that do many things,*  
*words that are hard to change,*  
*words that can't be re-used elsewhere.*


*Some break down their Messy words -*  
*combinations of simpler, re-usable gems!*  
*This makes building new programs easier and also a joy.*


*But this takes patience even for the experienced.*
